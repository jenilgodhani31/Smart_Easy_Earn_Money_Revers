        timeRequired: `First, you should sign up for the Amazon Associate program. You’ll need to provide your website’s name while signing up. Amazon will analyze your website, and if they find it appropriate according to their standards they will approve you as an official Amazon associate. The approval process might take 2 to 5 days. Once you’re approved, find out the relevant products you want to promote on your blog then grab their affiliate links and insert them into your website.`,
        tips: [
          "1.  Dig out relevant products - The first and most important thing is to find out the products that are relevant to your website’s or blog’s content and audience. The more relevant the product, the better chance you’ll have of selling. For example, promoting wristwatches on a blog that teaches people to do Yoga exercises is highly unlikely to make you any sale. But instead, if you try to promote Yoga mats, pants, and books you’ll see great success.",
          "2.  Place affiliate links inside your content - Placing simple text links within the context of an article is the most effective way to get people to click your affiliate links. People trust the body of the content on a page more than any other area of the website. Hence it is very likely that they will click on the link when it’s placed inside the content’s body. For example, “Check out this cool smartwatch. It has retained the position of No 1 bestseller since last two months.”",
          "3.  Link product images to Amazon - Images play an important role in grabbing visitor’s attention. Another simple way to get people to click on your affiliate links is to use lots of high-quality product images and make those images as clickable affiliate links. One good thing about Amazon is that it allows you to freely use any product’s image on your website for promotional purposes.",
          "4.  Write a product review article - Doing a quality product review and writing a great article explaining all the facets of a product is another great way to generate high click-thru rates and sales. But while doing any review make sure it is of high quality and unbiased. People shouldn’t think that you are badly trying to get them to buy the product. A high-quality review should answer all the answers and clear confusion or reservations any potential buyer might have. Make sure your review does cover all the above-mentioned aspects.",
          "5.  Just send people to Amazon - One of the great things about Amazon is that it is very good at converting visitors into buyers. You don’t need to follow them nor target them with ads, Amazon will do the rest for you. All you need to do is send them to Amazon.com through your affiliate link. The great thing about this is when somebody visits Amazon.com through your link you get a percentage of anything they buy for the next 24 hours. For example, if one person clicks on your “Yoga Mat” affiliate link and visits Amazon.com and buys 2 wristwatches instead of a Yoga Mat within 24 hours, you’ll get commissions for the wristwatch sales even if you didn’t promote it directly.",
          "6.  Build loyalty and trust - One major factor that will boost your sales is your reader's’ loyalty and trust towards you and your website. Most of your sales will come people who are loyal and repeat readers. Readers who connect with you on a regular basis, over the long period, begin to trust you and your website. So when you make any recommendation or do a review, they are more likely to take that advice than someone who they don’t trust."

Just ask yourself, what would a potential buyer for this item type into the search box?",
          "Write item’s description - Fill out all the fields in your listing, and make sure your textual description is providing all the information that your potential buyer might look for. Most lazy sellers ignore this and fail badly at selling anything on eBay.",

        subTitle: [
          "Among all property types, condos have the most number of agents and brokers due to the sheer number of units that can be sold and earn commissions from. With more people involved, the more the competition. With more competition, the more creative ideas for persuasion. With more ideas for persuasion, more facts are flipped to make it look like condos are the best...Investment...Ever...",
          "It is true that millions of people have benefited from condo investing. There is no question about that. Even I have condo investments. The point is, it is not all rosy and you need to consider these things before you invest. If you are okay with all these considerations, then by all means invest in a condo. ",
          "(1) There is no perpetual ownership with any condo including freehold. There are 2 types of condo ownership. First is leasehold where you own it for a given time (eg. 50 to 99 years) and return it to the developer or government after the lease term. The other one is freehold where in principle you have perpetual ownership of the unit. Perpetual ownership is a misleading term but actually refers to 1 lifetime. It will last for you and your son's generation but will not last when your grandchildren reach mid-age. ",
          "The life expectancy of conventional buildings with masonry and wood is 120 years. More modern buildings with glass walls and reinforced concrete are 60 years... No big deal, I only intend to use it in my lifetime. If this is you then you have no problem with condos. If you want your assets to be passed on, then you cannot do this with condos. ",
          "Think about it, structures especially in today's world, aluminum, steel, nails, bolts, and other construction materials are mostly made in China, will they last forever? Obviously not. Have you tried fixing a screw lately? They are terribly soft nowadays. Don't believe condo agents who will tell you condos are perpetual ownership. There is no such thing. In your lifetime, yes but not perpetual. Hey, perpetual here means, your lifetime. There is no perpetual ownership with any real estate? Houses also need to be taken down eventually... Well, when purchasing a house and lot, you purchase the lot, in normal circumstances, by definition, no one can take that away from you, forever. Now that's perpetual ownership. With a condo are you entitled to a piece of land? No. Are you given fair compensation when it is time to demolish the building? No, who would compensate you for your property? The government? - dream on."
        ],

        sellingInfo: [
          "Now, this app is not against condo investing per se. Condos are good due to their proximity to certain establishments. They are good for convenience. This app only aims to expose different styles of persuasion and sometimes lies that agents and brokers use to deceive people. ",
          "(2) Condos tend to depreciate in price after 10 years of turnover. What? Of course not, how can this be? Have you seen a condo bought at 1,000,000 and sold at 500,000 after 20 years? What agents and brokers fail to factor in is inflation. You may purchase a condo worth 1,000,000 today and sell it for 1,200,000 after 20 years, gain but that is just due to the effect of inflation. Everything will be more expensive 20 years from now. If you compute for the present value and factor in inflation, you may not earn anything at all or at best with minimal gains. The question is, will your money could have been invested in a better investment vehicle? ",
          "To explain price depreciation logically, prices of anything are dictated by supply and demand. Try selling a very old condo and see if you have a lot of buyers. People would prefer newer buildings obviously. If your area is a high-growth area, do you think your condo building is the only condo building there? Chances are the answer is no. Most likely there would always be newer buildings every 5 to 10 years there. ",
          "(3) Another popular argument agents and brokers would tell you is you can easily flip it. Buy now during preselling and sell it during the turnover period and get thousands just by sitting on it for a few years. In reality, not everyone can do it successfully. It is a combination of skill and luck, a lot of luck. Real estate investing including condos is in most cases the single biggest investment of an ordinary household. You also need to consider taxes, transfer fees, developer penalties. In some countries, fees can reach up to 30% of the price you bought it for. Bottom line is, it is not very easy to flip properties. Otherwise, each and every one of us would do it. ",
          "(4) Another thing to consider when investing in condos is the condo dues. Some posh condominiums would charge a per sqm fee that is more than the rent of a middle-class condominium. If you are having the condo rented and there is a high vacancy, guess what, you still need to pay the condo dues. In some condos, utilities like water and electricity are charged higher because they are considered commercial rates. ",
          "(5) Lastly, agents and brokers would tell you that you can earn passive income for life. They would usually jack up the actual rental price for the property. They would say, it can be rented for 25,000 per month but in reality that is impossible to meet. 25,000 per month if you are the only one having a unit available for rent, but usually there are hundreds of you in the same building. The actual rental yield is usually 20% to 30% lower compared to their projections."
        ],
        proTips: [

          "Consider all the above points when making a condo investment. Make sure you have done all the research and analysis yourself. Do not rely on what the agent tells you. Remember, most agents and brokers (not all), are there primarily for commissions and not really considering what is best for you financially. Real estate agents unlike professional financial planners who are not affiliated with any real estate developer, would tell you that you can only afford a maximum of 36% of income going to debt payment including house mortgage. This is for financial security. Investment advisors from real estate properties on the other hand will tell you, buy as much as you can now so you don't miss out on opportunities.",
          "Lastly, be cautious when purchasing a pre-owned condo unit. Sellers would usually make it sound the property is newer. Oh, this property is 2 years old - in reality, they had it for 2 years, but the actual structure is 10 years old just newly painted. Always search the internet for the actual age of the building. DO NOT ASK THE AGENT. Why do they do this? Why would they tell you the wrong information and hope you don't find out the truth? No one wants to buy an old property."

Houses with a huge space can also be sub-leased to companies as a staff house. This is most effective if you have properties near universities, tertiary hospitals, warehouses, depots, and offices. ",
          "Another way to earn from real estate is by the Buy-Renovate-Sell method or flipping. Obviously, this is not for everyone as you need construction, design, and marketing expertise. This is usually done by small and medium enterprises focused on flipping business rather than the average joe. This can be a very profitable business as we mentioned because properties don't have an expiration date and they always appreciate over time. If the property sector is down, no problem, you can have it rented then sell eventually when things get better. ",
          "There are a lot of advantages when investing in REITs. (1) Liquidity - you can easily sell your shares with REITs unlike with real properties where you need to pay a lot of taxes and wait for 2 to 3 years before being able to liquidate. (2) Another advantage is no need to manage the property yourself. No need to search and screen for tenants, no need to haggle for rent, no need to stress over delayed payments, no need to go to the property to repair plumbings, wirings, leaks. In short, no more stress! (3) Capital appreciation - share prices of REITs can also increase over time (but generally slower than real properties) if the fund managers decide to purchase a new property which would increase the dividend yield, therefore, command a higher share price.

If you are earning $4,000 a month, the maximum amount you can allot to pay a home mortgage is $1,120 ($4,000 x 20%) including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance. Total debt should not exceed $1,440 ($4,000 x 36%). ",
          "According to Investopedia, if you are planning to invest in a house, a good rule of thumb is 2 to 2.5 times your gross annual income is a house that you can afford. If you are earning $100,000 per year, you can afford a $200,000 to $250,000 house. ",

          "Money Strategy When Investing in Multiple Rental Properties: (1) get the lowest downpayment term and (2) borrow with the longest term possible. If you do get the lowest downpayment term, you have enough money to acquire another property. If you borrow with the longest term, the rental income may be enough to pay for the monthly amortization. You can always pay it earlier if you have spare money. Follow Schaub's 10/10/10 rule - pay no more than 10% downpayment, avail no more than 10% interest rate for loans, and buy 10% below market value."

Check the ceiling and see if there are any water stains. If the property has appliances, turn it all ON and see if there is an electrical overload. When purchasing a house, consider putting an agreement that if there are problems with the house in the next 6 months, the seller would be liable."

          "(3) Price - if you are buying a condo, check the secondary market if someone is selling their unit. The secondary market is usually way lower compared to the developer price. ",
          "If you are buying a pre-owned property, you can get the value of a property by either hiring an assessor or computing the per sqm price and adding the per sqm construction cost (not the practice in the US and Europe). For example, you are looking at a 300 sqm lot area with a 200 sqm floor area. Check the lots that are for sale in the area. If you get a 5,000 per sqm price then multiple 300 x 5,000 = 1,500,000 this is the price of the lot. Then search on the internet, the construction cost of a house per sqm in the area. This is usually divided according to build quality and finish - low end, mid-end, or high end. Apply this value to the property you are looking at. For example, 20,000 per sqm is your cost to build a house, yours would be 200 sqm x 20,000 = 4,000,000. Add both lot (1,500,000) and house cost (4,000,000), less depreciation (total house cost divided by 50 multiplied by the number of years). If the house is 5 years old then the depreciation cost would be (4,000,000 /50 * 5 = 400,000). So the total estimated value of this property would be 1,500,000 + 4,000,000 - 400,000 = 5,100,000. Compare this value with the surrounding properties and you have your house value. ",

          "(4) Other things to check are the condo dues or village or association dues that you have to pay per month. Check also the track record of the developer that you are purchasing from.

The simple answer is no. A win-win situation is always best in any negotiation.",

If after an educated valuation you came up with a price of $300,000, and the property is being sold for $400,000. You can make an offer of +/- 10% of your calculated price.

I bought this for XXX amount and you are offering a lower price. Do not care. You are not responsible for their miscalculation. You get the idea. Calculate your fair value of a property, formulate your own logical reasons for buying a property, and stick to your offer and plan. The best way to take out emotions in negotiation is to have alternatives.

Once you've laid out your terms, send it to the seller/broker and wait for their reply. You do not need to say anything. When they go to the explanation phase, tell them nicely that you do not need to hear anything because you have already computed for the fair value and your offer is fixed. After that, do not message, do not call, do not do anything. If your valuation is correct, just watch the seller/broker go down to your price eventually. If the property is for you, it is for you.

          `You can sell at Etsy and access thousands of potential customers for a small fee of $0.20 per listing - no need for an expensive rental space. All listings with Etsy are valid for 4 months or until the products are sold out. A listing means 1 item. If you are selling a dress with different sizes, you can add them as variations on the same listing. `,
          `You can start by signing up and setting up your own Etsy store. You need a shop name, language, pictures, and mode of payment. If someone buys an item from your Etsy shop, Etsy charges a 3.5% transaction fee and a 4.4% + $0.26 processing fee. Selling in Etsy is much like setting up your own physical store minus the expensive rental space. You create product displays, fulfill orders, do refunds, customer support, the whole thing. Etsy is available worldwide and pays via bank deposit and PayPal. `

It’s recommended that you should get at least 10-15 feedbacks before selling anything.",
          "Start small - Most of the eBay resellers buy bulk wholesale stock of any particular product then sell it on eBay at a retail price. If you don’t have money to buy a wholesale stock then find out unwanted items present in your house which are in good condition and make a list of them.",
          "Research - Now as you have a list of few ready to sell items you must ensure that there is a market for them. Take 10 minutes to Google your item and uncover its true market value on eBay and another bunch of e-commerce sites. This will help you to sell the right items more competitively because you’ll have the knowledge of your item’s market and its pricing strategies. Also, dig out relevant targeted keywords which will help people to find your items via Google search engine.",
          "Craft the title - Title is the single most important factor for grabbing the attention of your potential buyer. Make sure your title is appealing, complete and you’ve included targeted keywords.",
          "Write item’s description - Fill out all the fields in your listing, and make sure your textual description is providing all the information that your potential buyer might look for. Most of the lazy sellers ignore this and fail badly at selling anything on eBay.",
          "Upload item’s pictures - Upload only high-quality pictures. Ensure that item’s pictures are new, clear (not blurry) and cover the product from all angles. Also, don’t restrict yourselves to 2-3 pictures upload at least 6 pictures.",
          "Timing - Most of the expert sellers use 10-day listing starting on Thursday, you should use it too, it will give you two full weekends of eyeballs. You’ll usually receive the highest traffic on weekends."

It is important to keep in mind that the secret of success when it comes to business risk is mitigating potential damage in favour of potential gain. Therefore, neither type of risk personality, in and of itself, provides an advantage over the other when it comes to risk management. A risk-­‐taker can just as easily overreach themselves as a risk adverse person can under reach themselves.",

So, while it appears that they are courting disaster, the reality is that the risks involved have been managed so as to control negative consequences.",

If you happen to make a bad decision then you own that fact, tighten your belt and move forward armed with the knowledge on how never to repeat that mistake.  This is a part of the process of growth. It is a process that demonstrates that the greatest opportunity arises from failure. By avoiding the repercussions of that failure, you also avoid the opportunity to grow as a leader and learn from your own mistakes. In other words, you condemn yourself to make that same mistake over and over. So, if and when you are faced with a bad business situation of your own making, don’t pass the buck.

Most of us will, hopefully, come away from a unique experience with a fresh perspective. Yet, very few of us grasp the enlightenment that is inherent in the day-to-day activities that, by necessity, take up the majority of our time. Buddhists call this awareness of the learning potential in the commonplace “mindfulness”. Successful business people understand this concept and utilize it to their advantage.",

In business, this means that you begin to pay closer attention to every task. You understand that each task fits into others and together they comprise the whole of your business enterprise. If you take a shortcut or cut corners on the smallest of things it only serves to undermine the largest and seemingly most important jobs. Likewise, when you attempt to do the most basic of jobs to the very best of your ability this mindful mindset carries over into other areas and brings a new level of excellence to your entire enterprise. So, use every experience, every day, as a moment to learn. Be mindful of bad or lazy behaviors and work to change them into more positive and productive actions.

When they do this, they not only fail to see that true success is not a destination (it’s a lifelong process) but they also fail to see the potential problems that routinely occur when striving for success. This means that when these problems do occur, the unprepared person is stopped dead in their tracks.

It turns out that many long-term successful individuals possess certain characteristics that they share with other long-term successful individuals. This set of characteristics has been termed a “growth mindset”. Now, some people, who tend to achieve less than their full potential, also possess a set of characteristics that they share with other under-achievers. This set of traits has been dubbed the “fixed mindset”. Most people, more or less, fall into one camp or the other.",

This desire leads to the ability to embrace challenges, to overcome setbacks, to see effort as worth the results, to accept criticism and to admire and learn from the successes of others. These behaviors allow native intelligence to grow throughout a lifetime. (Hence, the name.) People with a growth mindset are believers in free will and this belief allows them to achieve their goals time and time again.",
        "People with a fixed mindset tend to have a desire to appear smart, with a corresponding fear of looking foolish. Their desire leads them to avoid challenges, to give up easily, to see extra effort as wasted, to ignore or reject criticism and to envy and begrudge the success of others. These behaviors tend to limit native intelligence to a fixed amount. (Again, hence the name.) People with a fixed mindset often plateau early in life and fail to have, let alone reach, fixed goals.",
        "The good news is that a growth mindset can be cultivated fairly easily by changing some critical behaviors. First of all, you have to decide to choose growth over stagnation. You also have to be willing to take positive action and begin to accept challenges and criticism and learning from both. An excellent way to begin is by developing the philosophy of “yet”. This simple step simple attaches the word “yet” to the end of every negative thought, as in “That will never work, yet...” or “It’s probably not worth going, yet...” This simple trick opens up the possibility for growth and that possibility leads to changed behavior that actually does cause the development of the growth mindset."

It is this desire that engenders the work ethic that’s necessary to succeed. That’s right, there is a definite work ethic that successful people bring to the table. If you want to succeed, then you have to emulate this work ethic. You have to want to succeed so much that you hustle.",
        "Hustle is all about walking the success walk. Anyone can talk about success. As they say, talk is cheap. You can talk about success all day long and not get one step closer to actually being successful. The only way to reach your goals is to put in the work necessary to get these. This work requires concentration, creativity, and conscious effort. There’s no secret here. You’re going to have to sweat to get there. The hours are long and the tasks are consuming. There’s no such thing as instant success or overnight success. Often the people who appear to be enjoying overnight success have hustled hard for months and years to get that success.",
        "So, remember that success means work and work means to hustle. Go the extra mile in everything you do. In the long run, those extra miles will put you ahead of the pack and that much closer to where you want to be."

        "There is probably nothing as important to achieving success as passion. It may sound extreme, but in order to reach a goal, you have to burn for it. It has to be something that’s on your mind all the time. To has to be all-consuming. In fact, passion is the flip side of our previous subject, hustle. The two go hand in hand with each other.",
        "So, how do they work together? Well, the one requires the other. They each, in some sense, drive the other. Finally, without one, you cannot have the other. Hustling, as we discussed, is all about hard work, long hours and the extra mile. Passion is the motivation that gets all that hard work done. Face it, if you’re not on fire about a project, you’re not going to be able to motivate yourself to do the hard work needed to complete that project successfully.",
        "So, how do you obtain or maintain the passion necessary for success? Well, as a business owner you should already be passionate about your business and its success. If you’re not, then you need to examine why. If you’re not doing what you love to do, then you may need to think about what you are passionate about and then get into that line of work. There’s no sense and no reason to waste your time trying to be enthusiastic about something that doesn’t move you. If you are already doing something you love to do, then you're halfway home. Let your love and passion for your line of work show through in that work. Your customers and competitors will notice the difference."

        "Creativity can be elusive. It’s not something that you can summon at will. When it happens, it strikes like lightning. Yet, like lightning, it can be maddeningly unpredictable. However, because creativity is an essential element of a successful business mindset, it is necessary to understand the creative process and how you, the business owner, can cultivate your own creative juices.",
        "The creative process is largely internal and unconscious. No one ever wakes up and says “Hey! Today I’m going to be creative.” Creativity is all about taking in a lot of influences and letting those influences combine, ferment and morph in your subconscious. Together, they form a sort of mental potting soil where new and different ideas have a chance to germinate and grow. The more things you learn, read, see and hear the more creative soil you are able to produce.",
        "So, as a business owner who wants to be creative, the best thing you can do is get out there and in the world and open yourself up to new experiences. Be curious about many different things. Develop hobbies. Challenge yourself. Do the unexpected. The more you push your own personal envelope the more you are charging your own creative batteries. When those batteries are charged, it is much more likely that inspiration will strike. Who knows where that new idea will take you?"

        "There is nothing more stifling to success than rigid thinking. Rigid thinking leads to rigid behaviours and rigid behaviours lead to dead ends, blind alleys, and creative cul de sacs. In other words, while there is a certain amount of comfort to routine, too much routine can choke off all chances that you will be able to successfully reach your business goals. Why? The answer is simple. The world, including the business world, is constantly changing. Rigid thinking and rigid behaviour, by definition, are resistant to change. Therefore, rigidity, in thought and action, spells obsolescence in the business world. Everyone else moves forward while you are left behind in the dust. So what’s the answer to this problem? In a word, flexibility.",
        "In today’s world, information is power, money, and control all rolled into one. The fast and free flow of information is what makes this possible. Everything changes quickly and what is a successful formula or a popular product in one cycle can be, and usually is, old news in the next. The only way to successfully stay on top of this bucking bronco of information and use it to your advantage is to be flexible enough to roll with the changes.",
        "Flexibility is easy to achieve as long as you are not too tied down to any single idea, product, service or manner of delivery. If you keep up with changing market conditions through the judicious use of the flow of information, you can easily spot new trends and adapt them successfully, usually before your competitors have had time to act. The only trick is to not fear change and, instead, embrace it. If change is the only reality in the business world then, to be successful in that world, change as to be your reality as well."

There are probably some of you reading this right now who still remain sceptical about positivism and its alleged beneficial effects. The thing is that while healthy scepticism is fine, an entrenched and cranky scepticism is usually a sign of negative thinking. So, if you haven’t tried positive thinking in your own business, yet remain sceptical of the concept, you have actually already proved that the power of positive thinking works.",
        "Positive thinking is about enjoying the ride that life provides. It’s about taking chances and seeing possibilities. It’s about flexibility, creativity and developing and maintaining a strong passion for those things that you loved. It’s about gusto, brio and doing things with panache. It is, in some sense, the very antithesis of rigid scepticism and preconceived negativity. It is, at its heart, an embrace of all of the powers each of us are capable of when we throw off the chains of tradition, expectation and routine results. It is a real thing and it works.",
        "To use the power of positive thinking in your own business you need to begin with a critical assessment of your own personal style and outlook. Make an honest examination of how you operate on a day to day basis. Are there areas where negativity, in any of its forms, outweighs positivity? If so, then there is room for positive change. Look at concepts like freedom, choice, possibility, optimism, and openness. Can you do more to increase your own options in any of these areas? Instead of asking yourself “How can I do this?” ask yourself instead “How can I NOT do this?” Changing your own personal management style to one that encompasses positivity on a daily basis can give you the freedom to choose success."

        "It is easy to expect success as if being successful was a right instead of a privilege and a gift. The problem with expecting to succeed is that, without more, the self-absorption of that expectation can slowly and subtly poison everything around you, including your business. True success is earned and when it arrives it should be, and needs to be, accompanied by a strong sense of gratitude. This gratitude is not simply about being grateful for what you’ve achieved. It is about being grounded enough in the moment of success to remember and recognize everyone who helped you get to this particular time and place. Without this grounded gratefulness any success is lessened and will, in all likelihood, be fleeting.",
        "So how do you repay those who helped you in achieving your goals? Well, obviously, acknowledging those individuals and sharing the benefits of your success with them is a great place to start. Yet, above and beyond taking care of your nearest and dearest, you also need to “pay it forward” by becoming a mentor and helper to others who are currently on their own journey towards success. Think about how you can collaborate with someone else in order to further their efforts. See if you can contribute in some way to their projects. This contribution doesn’t have to be monetary. Advice and the wisdom of experience are often far more valuable than cold cash.",
        "This gratitude can extend even further. There are people who are currently helping you every day that you may not see as mentors. Your customers are among these people. Without them, success becomes impossible. Take the time to let them know how important they are. Your vendors are also equally important. Yes, they provide you with materials that you pay them for, but a true grounded and grateful attitude would also recognize each of them for the critical element they play in your business. Look outside the box and you’ll see that success is not a solo effort, it’s a team sport."

Your talents and abilities, your intelligence and interests, your opinions and tastes, make you who you are. There is no need to hide a part of yourself or alter a part of yourself for the sake of conformity. True success is about freedom and all truly successful people are individualists who have, more or less, accepted and glorified who they are. You should do the same.",

The gift and the privilege of life are that you get to be yourself, the best self you can possibly be. Use the gift, take advantage of the privilege that you’ve been given. Don’t squander the chance.
